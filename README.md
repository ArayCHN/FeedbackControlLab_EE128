## Feedback Control Systems

This repository stores all the lab done in course EE128 during my fall 2107 exchange at UC Berkeley.

The most interesting experiments are lab5b and lab6d, where I implemented a MagLev system that can levitate three metal balls, and actively controlled a cart such that it can erect an inverted pendulum from a balanced starting position(drooping position), respectively.

You can check out videos of these labs at my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdtVW_FT8fk0XjNpyHenCMQ/videos). The video for lab5b is [here](https://youtu.be/8Vr_G6Wh5q4).

Some lab details can also be found on [my website](http://aray.pub).
